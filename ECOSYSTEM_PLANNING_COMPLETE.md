2. **Plumbing API** - Pipe sizing, fixtures, code compliance  
3. **HVAC API** - Load calculations, equipment sizing
4. **Painting API** - Surface prep, coverage calculations

**Priority 2 APIs:**
5. **Work Order API** - Task creation and tracking
6. **Scheduling API** - Resource allocation, critical path
7. **Workflow API** - Process automation

### **💼 PHASE 2: Business Operations (4-6 weeks)**
8. **Proposal API** - Automated proposal generation
9. **Estimate/Invoice API** - Cost breakdowns, tax calculations

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Railway Deployment (Next 24-48 hours)**
The Railway deployment fix has been implemented but needs to be deployed:

```bash
# Test the fix:
curl -I https://fireapi.dev/api/health

# Expected: JSON response with Content-Type: application/json
# Problem: If still returning HTML, redeploy with the new .railwayignore
```

**If fix needs deployment:**
1. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new `.railwayignore` file
2. HTML files are now excluded from backend deployment
3. API will serve JSON responses only

### **⚡ Week 1 Sprint (Starting Monday)**
1. **Verify Railway Fix** - Confirm `fireapi.dev` serves JSON API
2. **Electrical API Development** - Following carpentry API pattern
3. **Plumbing API Development** - Parallel development track
4. **Integration Testing** - Multi-trade orchestration validation
